freedom.js Logging Demo
=======================

This is a demonstration of the logging capabilities of freedom.js. It shows
how an application would install a custom logging provider, which can alter
the logging behavior of the system, through custom filtering or similar
mechanisms.

This has been a request from freedom.js applications which don't want to
develop their own logging framework, but also want more advanced logging
behavior, including the ability to send logs back to their own servers,
display recent logs on demand in the page itself, or control filtering
with more granularity than simply level.
