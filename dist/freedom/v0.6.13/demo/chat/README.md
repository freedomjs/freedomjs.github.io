freedom.js Chat Demo
====================

An example chat room, where your buddylist is displayed with a message log.
You can click on another user and send directed private messages to them.

The current example uses a specific social provider that implements a
global buddylist, where each user is assigned a random GUID.
(source in /providers/social/websocket-server/)

A more complete version of this example is in the [freedom-social-xmpp](
https://www.github.com/freedomjs/freedom-social-xmpp) repository, which uses
the same example code linked to a full XMPP social network in both chrome
and firefox.
