Custom Channels
======

A simple example showing dynamic creation, messaging, and deletion of custom
channels between modules. This example is meant primarily for testing purposes,
because it demonstrates all of the different communications primatives
in freedom.js:
* Implicit channels.
* Explicit API channels.
* Runtime-created custom channels.
