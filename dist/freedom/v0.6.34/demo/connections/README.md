freedom.js Connections Demo
=================

A freedom module showing an active network visually. This example is meant
to be a teaser for freedom.js, showing just how easy it is to create
distributed applications using the framework.

Connections are made using the anonymous social provide bundled with
freedom.js (source at /providers/social/websocket-server/)

This example can be easily modifed to show activity on your site, or on a
social network of your choice, through simple modification of the manifest.
We offer a drop-in replacement that connecs to an XMPP server (such as G+ or
Facebook), which this example can use without any additional changes.
