FreeDOM Connections Demo
=================

A freedom module showing your network state visually. Aims to provide a flashy
taste of freedom.js, showing how easy it is to create distributed applications
using the framework.

The connections are made using the anonymous social provide bundled with
freedom.js (source at /providers/social/websocket-server/)

This example can be easily modifed to show activity on your site, or on your
social network, through simple modification of the manifest.
We offer a drop-in repalcement that connecs to an XMPP server (such as G+ or
Facebook), which the application can then use without any further changes.
