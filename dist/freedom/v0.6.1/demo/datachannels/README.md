Counter
======

Counter is a simple hello world example, which creates a single root FreeDOM module
that implements a counter.
This demo shows you how to interact with FreeDOM modules using a message-passing interface.
User actions are forwarded from the page to the counter module.
The aggregate count is sent from the counter module back to the outer page.
